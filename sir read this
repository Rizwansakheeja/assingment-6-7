# assingment-6-7
Dear Sir,
As you can see i've submitted assignment 6 and 7 together.
This is because my aunt is in the hospital from two weeks and she's in a critical condition.
As she has no son and I'm the only one among my brothers who's young and unemployed. I'm taking care of her at the hospital. 
She's in the icu at the moment and still critical. 
I couldn't do the assignment at the hospital obviously so whenever i got home for a few hours, i worked on the assignment with whatever time i was given. 
For a long time my only routine is sleeping, eating, hospital, and if I'm lucky, working on assignment. 
So i request you to please understand my situation and please consider my 6th assignment alongside 7th.
